									<h3 class="major">Description</h3>
									<p>The overall goal of this project was to produce a program capable of predicting the outcome of NBA basketball games
                                        with greater accuracy than a human could do with the simple stats that are available. More specifically, I wanted to
                                        be able to predict the games based off of the stats that were available at halftime of each game. My approach to 
                                        solving the problem was using a deep neural network that would learn from NBA games of the past in order to identify
                                        trends that may be difficult for humans to observe.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="major">Data</h3>
									<p>
                                        I designed a python program that scraped data from basketballreference.com (while respecting rate limits). Using previous basketball knowledge, 
                                        I identified 14 different statistics that would be available both at halftime and at the end of each game. I avoided
                                        the more advanced stats that are created by various combinations of the simple counting stats because a well designed 
                                        neural network should have the capacity to see the relationships between the simple stats without human intervention.
                                        In fact, a neural network should be able to come up with weighted relationships that are even more accurate than the 
                                        relationships that humans can identity on their own. I had the program scrape that data from over 30,000 NBA games 
                                        dating back to the year 2000. I also calculated season averages for each team up until the game that they were currently
                                        playing - we couldn't use total season averages because that data wouldn't be available in real life dues to those games not 
                                        being played yet.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Model</h3>
										The data used here was entirely tabular with no spatial relationships, thus using any version of a convolutional neural network would not be
										effective. Instead, a fully connected network was utilized. Various different modifications were made to both the data and the network itself in 
										order to optimize the models. These modifications included:
										<ul> 
											<li><Strong>Number of Hidden Layers</Strong> -  Anything above 3 hidden layers resulted in overfitting. </li>
											<li><Strong>Loss Function </Strong> -  While a 2 output final score was more intuitive, using one output representing score difference was most effective.</li>
											<li><Strong>Data Normalization</Strong> - Normalizing each data point across all trials improved both accuracy and stability.</li>
											<li><Strong>Batch Normalization</Strong> - Adding a batch normalization (activations across a batch) layer to the network drastically improved accuracy. </li>
											<li><Strong>Varied Data Sets</Strong> - First quarter data was omitted in some trials. This seems to have little to now effect on the outcomes. Using temporal data, which
																					was aquired by calculating averages from the previous ten games,resulted in the most effective runs.</li>
										</ul>
										<p></p>
										<p>Here are a few examples of model validation accuracy during training (accuracy on the Y-Axis and training iterations on the X-Axis ):</p>

									<h3 class="major">Results</h3>
									<p> As a baseline measure, I compared the model's accuracy to a simple caculation that any human could do: the team that was winning at halftime would win the game. While all 
										versions of the neural network that I designed ended up being more accurate than this measure, some were more accurate than others. The most accurate model was able to 
										predict 1.96% more games correctly than the simplified system. The following table shows a summary of the results:
