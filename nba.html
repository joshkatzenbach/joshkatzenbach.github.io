									<h3 class="major">Description</h3>
									<p>The overall goal of this project was to produce a program capable of predicting the outcome of NBA basketball games
                                        with greater accuracy than a human could do with the simple stats that are available. More specifically, I wanted to
                                        be able to predict the games based off of the stats that were available at halftime of each game. My approach to 
                                        solving the problem was using a deep neural network that would learn from NBA games of the past in order to identify
                                        trends that may be difficult for humans to observe.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="major">Data</h3>
									<p>
                                        I designed a python program that scraped data from basketballreference.com (while respecting rate limits). Using previous basketball knowledge, 
                                        I identified 14 different statistics that would be available both at halftime and at the end of each game. I avoided
                                        the more advanced stats that are created by various combinations of the simple counting stats because a well designed 
                                        neural network should have the capacity to see the relationships between the simple stats without human intervention.
                                        In fact, a neural network should be able to come up with weighted relationships that are even more accurate than the 
                                        relationships that humans can identity on their own. I had the program scrape that data from over 30,000 NBA games 
                                        dating back to the year 2000. I also calculated season averages for each team up until the game that they were currently
                                        playing - we couldn't use total season averages because that data wouldn't be available in real life dues to those games not 
                                        being played yet.
