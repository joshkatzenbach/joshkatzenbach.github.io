									<h3 class="major">Description</h3>
									<p> This is clone of the classic Space Invaders video game. It includes all the typical elements: aliens that shoot, a ufo for extra points,
                                        limited lives, the ability to move, and a high score screen. The game was written in C and runs on a linux embedded system. This particular
                                        system had a Zynq chip, allowing hardware to be configured like an FPGA, but also run like an ARM processor. All aspects of the game and 
                                        the drivers were coded in C. 
                                    </p>

                                    <h3 class="major">Userspace</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Certain drivers, specifically those controlling the buttons, switches, and the fixed interval timer (FIT) were written in userspace. These
                                        drivers interacted with the hardware using the Userspace I/O driver (UIO). 
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="major">Kernel</h3>
									<p>
                                        Other, more complex drivers, were written as kernel modules. These drivers included the audio codec for the game and the programmable interval
                                        timer (PIT). This meant that these modules needed to be registered and inserted into the kernel before being able to use them. In order to 
                                        effectively insert these drivers into the kernel, I had to study extensive documentation kernel documentation.
                                        Additionally, the actual hardware for the programmable interval timer was built using SystemVerilog in vivado. 
									</p>

                                    <h3 class="major">Hardware</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        While most of the necessary hardware came on the Zynq board, I actually used SystemVerilog code to design the hardware necessary for the PIT.
                                        This hardware was then added to the FPGA portion of the board, as well as being registered in the linux system tree.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3 class="major">Code Efficiency</h3>
                                    <p> In order for the game to run properly, it was essential to make the code efficient enought to move dozens of objects on the screen between 
                                        each interrupt. Each sprite (on screen game element) needed to be redrawn in between each interrupt.
                                    </p>
