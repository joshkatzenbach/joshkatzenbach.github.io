									<h3 class="major">Project Overview</h3>
									<p>
										I developed a complete laser tag system. First, the hardware to detect, amplify, and filter the signals. Second, the software to run the game, process the signals, and keep score.
										All software was coded in C and embedded into a microcontroller. 
									</p>
									<h3 class = "major">Receiver Board</h3>
									<p>
										In order to accurately detect a laser tag single, I developed a circuit board to process the signals. The first piece of hardware was a simple photodiode that would
										produce a voltage when hit with a beam of light coming from the laser tag gun. In order to make the signal strong enough to eventually read digital, I designed an 
										amplification process that used a 2 stage setup with operational amplifies. After these amplifies, I utilized capacitors and resistors as an 
										analog filter to remove all of noise signals that inevitably contaminated the signal. Finally, I designed a small clipping circuit using operational amplifiers and diodes
										to limit the outgoing voltage to less than one volt to avoid damaging the microcontroller that would come later on in the circuit. LTspice was used to design the orginal 
										circuit. We then built it and adjusted it in a breadboard before designing and ordering a PCB.

									<h3 class= "major">Digital Filtering</h3>
									<p>
										After the signal went through initial processing by the receiver board, it was sent to the microcontroller. We then designed a two stage filter system in matlab and 
										afterwards implemented the code in C to be put on our embedded microcontroller. The first filter was an anti-aliasing FIR filter that eliminated any high frequency signals
										that could be misinterpreted as lower frequencies by the other filters. Afterward, the signal was sent through 10 different bandpass filters to determine the exact frequency
										that was detected. From here, we could determine which player shot, and thus awared points in the software accordingly. 
									</p>
									<h3 class="major">Frequencies</h3>
									<p>
										The embedded program also contained the appropriate state machines to give each player their own specific light frequency. By decidiing how many clock cycles would pass between
										turning on and off the LED, we could produce a frequency that would be picked up by the receive board, processed by the digital filters, and eventually determine who had shot 
										who for scoring purposes.
